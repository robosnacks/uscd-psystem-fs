RELEASE NOTES
       This section details the various features and bug fixes of the various
       releases.

   Version 1.22 (2012-Jul-08)
       * The web site was not updating the version number correctly, due to a
         missing build dependency rule.

       * A false positive has been fixed in test 20.

   Version 1.21 (2011-May-24)
       * There is a new ucsdpsys_disk(1) --system-volume option, which may be
       used to test whether or not a disk image looks like a system disk.  It
       is intended for use by shell scripts.

   Version 1.20 (2010-Oct-11)
       * The ucsdpsys_charset(1) command has been moved to the ucsd-psystem-xc
         project.

       * There is a new ucsdpsys_disk(1) --wipe-unused option, used to reset
         unused blocks to zero.

   Version 1.19 (2010-Sep-18)
       * There is now a pre-built package in the LaunchPad PPA, and a link
         from the ucsd-psystem-fs web site.

       * An Ubuntu Maverick build problem was fixed.

       * Several test false negatives were foxed.

   Version 1.18 (2010-Sep-12)
       * The debian packaging Build-Depends was missing libboost-dev

   Version 1.17 (2010-Sep-09)
       * A build problem on i386 Linux has been fixed.  The large file
         mechanism is fragile.

   Version 1.16 (2010-Sep-08)
       * A build problem on 32-bit Linux machines has been fixed, a necessary
         include file had been omitted in several places.

       * All of the commands now ask libexplain for a four column hanging
         indent on each error message.  This makes it easier to see when one
         ends and the next begins.

   Version 1.15 (2010-Aug-24)
       * The package now depends on libexplain
         (http://libexplain.sourceforge/net/) for its error messages and error
         handling.

       * The ucsdpsys_disk(1) and ucsdpsys_mkfs(1) commands now understand how
         to write the boot blocks.

   Version 1.14 (2010-Jun-22)
       * The ucsdpsys_disk(1) command has a new --all option, that can be used
         to request that dot-files also be transferred when a while directory
         is being added to a disk image.  By default dot-files are ignored.

       * The ucsdpsys_mkfs(1) command now defaults its disk size based on the
         --architecture given.

   Version 1.13 (2010-Jun-20)
       * The ucsdpsys_mkfs(1) command has a new --architecture option, that
         can be used to set the byte sex of the new file system.  See
         ucsdpsys_mkfs(1) for more information.

       * There is a new ucsdpsys_rt11(1) command, that may be used to extract
         files from an RT-11 disk image.

   Version 1.12 (2010-Jun-18)
       * Some verbose, annoying, left-over debugging code has been removed
         from the sort-by-name directory listing.

   Version 1.11 (2010-Jun-16)
       * The ucsdpsys_disk(1) command now allows you to specify the sort
         criteria for the file listing.  See the ucsdpsys_disk(1) man page for
         more information.

       * The ucsdpsys_disk(1) command can now move all of the files to the
         beginning of the disk image, maximizing the space available for the
         UCSD p-System to work with.  See the ucsdpsys_disk(1) man page for
         more information.

   Version 1.9 (2010-May-30)
       * It is now possible to specify a third interleave type on the
         ucsdpsys_mkfs(1) command line, see the man page for details.

       * The file system now silently translates shash (/) characters in file
         names into underscore (_) characters.  This was causing a very
         mysterious and uninformative error message to be reported.

       * The ucsdpsys_mkfs(1) command's --label option now converts the label
         to upper case before writing it to the disk image/

   Version 1.8 (2010-Apr-09)
       * The commands now all understand long option names.

       * A bug has been fixed in the file-kind guessing code, it no longer
         tries to make SYSTEM.PASCAL a text file.

       * It is now possible to add a size suffix when specifying the size to
         ucsdpsys_mkfs(1).

   Version 1.7 (2010-Apr-03)
       * The code that tries to divine the file type from the file's name, has
         been extended to understand more of the types of the system files.

       * The .imd format code is now able to cope with broken sector maps.

       * There is a new ucsdpsys_interleave -Tguess option, for guessing the
         interleave of a disk image.

       * The code has been made more robust around volume header records with
         incorrect dnumfiles fields.  This is now detected, and can be
         repaired with the ucsdpsys_fsck(1) command.

   Version 1.6 (2008-Jan-20)
       * There is a new ucsdpsys_mount -t option, which may be used to have
         text files converted text files between Unix and UCSD formats on-the-
         fly.

       * The ucsdpsys_umount(1) command now exits with a non-zero exit status
         if it runs out of retries.  It also emits a comforting message if it
         succeeds after more than one attempt.

       * The FUSE behaviour has changed slightly, and it is now sometimes
         necessary to retry umount attempts is within (about) a second of the
         last access.  We use usleep(2) if available to minimize the time
         spent sleeping.

   Version 1.5 (2008-Jan-10)
       * The text file decoding can now cope with text block padding in the
         first block.

       * The Teledisk TD0 format is now understood for reading. See
         http://www.classiccmp.org/dunfield/img/td0notes.txt for a
         description.

   Version 1.4 (2007-Sep-10)
       * The IMageDisk (IMD) format is now supported for reading.

       * The license has been changed to GNU GPL version 3.

   Version 1.3 (2007-Apr-04)
       * A couple of build problems have been fixed.

       * Files ending in .pas are now considered text files.

       * The file names in the system are now converted to upper case
         automatically.  This is bacuse the p-System performs case sensitive
         file name comparisons some of the time, and case insensitive at other
         times.  The only way to work consistently is to always convert the
         names of new files to upper case.

       * The ucsdpsys_disk(1) command now automagically converts text files
         during put (-p) and get (-p) operations unless specifically requested
         to berform binary transfers (-B).

       * The ucsdpsys_disk(1) command now preserves the modification date (as
         far as is possible) across gets (-g) and puts (-p).

       * The ucsdpsys_disk(1) command is now able to get and put whole
         directories from and to UCSD p-System disk images.

   Version 1.2 (2006-Apr-16)
       * A bug has been fixed in the ucsdpsys_text(1) program.  It no longer
         inserts tab characters in the text of a line when a tab is in the
         Unix file at that position - space characters are inserted instead. A
         warning is issued for all other cases of non-printing characters.

       * A bug has been fixed in the date-last-modified file meta-data.  The
         bit layout being used for dates was wrong.

       * The ucsdpsys_disk(1) command now understands how to manipulate disk
         files which have differing Unix and p-System file names.

       * The ucsdpsys_disk(1) directory listings now resemble the original
         more closely.

       * The write(2) handling in the file system has been improved.  It now
         uses the existing gap beyond the current file if that will serve
         immediate needs.  This saves expensive block shuufling to make a gap
         we didn't need.  This situation can arrise, for example, as a result
         of an open with O_TRUNC specified.

   Version 1.1 (2006-Apr-11)
       * The ucsdpsys_mount(1) is used to mount a UCSD p-System filesystem
         disk image as a Linux file system.  See ucsdpsys_mount(1) for more
         information.

       * The ucsdpsys_umount(1) is used to unmount a filesystem mounted by the
         ucsdpsys_mount(1) command.  See ucsdpsys_umount(1) for more
         information.

       * The ucsdpsys_mkfs(1) is used to create a new empty UCSD p-System
         filesystem disk image.  See ucsdpsys_mkfs(1) for more information.

       * The ucsdpsys_fsck(1) is used to verify and repair a UCSD p-System
         filesystem disk image.  See ucsdpsys_fsck(1) for more information.

       * The ucsdpsys_disk(1) is used to list, extract, insert and remove
         files from a UCSD p-System filesystem disk image, without mounting
         it.  See ucsdpsys_disk(1) for more information.

       * The ucsdpsys_text(1) is used to convert text files from the UCSD p-
         System format to a Unix text file, and back again.  See
         ucsdpsys_text(1) for more information.
