 * Compare two files using fcomp.  The -w option produces an output of
 * the entire file, with insertions an deletions marked by "change bars"
 * in the left margin.  This is superior to context difference, as it
 * shows the entire file as context.  The -s option could be added to
 * compare runs of white space as equal.
 *
 * This command is used by aed(1) to produce a difference listing when
 * file in the development directory was originally copied from the
 * current version in the baseline.
 *
 * All of the command substitutions described in aesub(5) are available.
 * In addition, the following substitutions are also available:
 *
 * ${ORiginal}
 *      The absolute path name of a file containing the version
 *      originally copied.  Usually in the baseline.
 * ${Input}
 *      The absolute path name of the edited version of the file.
 *      Usually in the development directory.
 * ${Output}
 *      The absolute path name of the file in which to write the
 *      difference listing.  Usually in the development directory.
 *
 * An exit status of 0 means successful, even of the files differ (and
 * they usually do).  An exit status which is non-zero means something
 * is wrong.
 *
 * The non-zero exit status may be used to overload this command with
 * extra tests, such as line length limits.  The difference files must
 * be produced in addition to these extra tests.
