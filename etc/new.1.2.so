.\" Change 23
The file names in the system are now converted to upper case
automatically.  This is bacuse the p\[hy]System performs case
\f[I]sensitive\fP file name comparisons some of the time, and case
\f[I]in\f[P]sensitive at other times.  The only way to work consistently
is to always convert the names of new files to upper case.

.\" Change 20
The \f[I]ucsdpsys_disk\fP(1) command now automagically converts text
files during put (\fB\-p\fP) and get (\fB\-p\fP) operations unless
specifically requested to berform binary transfers (\fB\-B\fP).

.\" Change 19
The \f[I]ucsdpsys_disk\fP(1) command now preserves the modification date
(as far as is possible) across gets (\fB\-g\fP) and puts (\fB\-p\fP).

The \f[I]ucsdpsys_disk\fP(1) command is now able to get and put whole
