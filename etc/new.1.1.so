A bug has been fixed in the \fIucsdpsys_text\fP(1) program.  It no longer
inserts tab characters in the text of a line when a tab is in
the Unix file at that position \- space characters are inserted
instead. A warning is issued for all other cases of non\[hy]printing
characters.

The \fIwrite\fP(2) handling in the file system has been improved.  It
now uses the existing gap beyond the current file if that will serve
immediate needs.  This saves expensive block shuufling to make a gap we
didn't need.  This situation can arrise, for example, as a result of an
open with O_TRUNC specified.
