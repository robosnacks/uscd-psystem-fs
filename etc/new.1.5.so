There is a new \f[I]ucsdpsys_mount \-t\fP option, which may be used
to have text files converted text files between Unix and UCSD formats
on\[hy]the\[hy]fly.

.\" Change 12

status if it runs out of retries.  It also emits a comforting
message if it succeeds after more than one attempt.

.if t \(bu
.\" Change 10
The FUSE behaviour has changed slightly, and it is now sometimes
necessary to retry umount attempts is within (about) a second of the
last access.  We use \f[I]usleep\fP(2) if available to minimize the time
