.SH Description:
The \fIucsd-psystem-fs\fP package is a collection of tools for
manipulating and mounting UCSD p-Systems disk images.
.sp
The disk images can be mounted into the file system by using the FUSE
\&"File System in User Space" package.
.sp
The ucsd-psystem-fs package runs on Linux.
If fuse and libfuse were to be ported to any other Unix,
it would run on them, too.
