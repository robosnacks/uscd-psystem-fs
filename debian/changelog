  * The ucsdpsys_mount -r flag (read-only) is now passed all they way down to
    the raw I/O for enforcement.  Whiel FUSE (and Linux) takes care of most of
    the read-only stuff, and never actually asks us to do the wrong this,
    provision is still made for handling this, becase it is possible that a
    program could be written to access the disk image directly, rather than
    mounting it as ucsdpsys_mount(1) does.

  * The disk image to be mounted can now be either interleaved or non-
    interleaved, and the code automagically copes.
  * Also, a bug has been fixed in the code which reads directories from thsi
    disk image into memory.  It was scanning too many entries.
